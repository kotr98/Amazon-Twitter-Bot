# Amazon-Twitter-Bot
This is a small bot which tweets if a product is available on amazon.

You can run this for example on a headless Raspberry Pi with necessary packages and drivers installed.
Also, you need the twitter API set up.
It will check every ten minutes if the product is available and tweet it once it is available.
