# Amazon-Twitter-Bot
This is a small bot which tweets if a product is available on amazon.

You can run this for example on a headless Raspberry Pi with necessary packages and drivers installed.<br/>
Also, you need the twitter API set up.<br/>
It will check every ten minutes if the product is available and tweet it once it is available.
